# 📊 Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Modeling

## 📌 Project Overview
This project showcases the **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model**, a widely used valuation technique to estimate a company’s intrinsic value. The model analyses historical financials, forecasts future cash flows, and discounts them to present value to determine enterprise and equity value.

### 🔹 Key Features
- **Financial forecasting** based on historical data and fundamental assumptions.
- **Free Cash Flow (FCF) calculation** to determine intrinsic value.
- **Discounting cash flows** to present value.
- **Fair value per share** estimation.

## 📈 Insights & Conclusion
### **Valuation Findings**
- **Fair Value per Share:** `$60.15`
- **Market Price (as of Dec 30, 2019):** `$73.14`
- **Growth Forecast:** `-17.76%`
- **📉 Recommendation:** 🚨 **SELL**

### **Key Takeaways**
✅ **Stock Overvaluation:** The market price **exceeds** the fair value, indicating **overvaluation** based on the DCF model.

✅ **Negative Growth Forecast:** The **-17.76% growth** suggests a potential decline in stock value, reinforcing a **sell recommendation**.

✅ **Enterprise & Equity Value:**
   - **Enterprise Value (EV):** `$142,248 million`
   - **Equity Value:** `$39,640 million`
   - **Shares Outstanding:** `659 million`

## 📌 Assumptions & Limitations
This valuation relies on assumptions about:
- **Revenue growth**, profit margins, and cost structure.
- **Capital expenditures & discount rates** for cash flow projections.
- **Macroeconomic conditions** that may impact future performance.

External market conditions should be considered alongside this valuation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 📑 **Excel** (financial modeling & forecasting)

🚀 This project offers a structured approach to corporate valuation using the DCF methodology, integrating key assumptions and **data-driven insights**.
